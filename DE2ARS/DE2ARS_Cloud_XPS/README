MODIFICATION
##################

You can change all the values in the input parameters file.
However, the number of file is limited to 67 200, due to automatic filename generation in the application. 
Also, this should be noted that, the number of VM is unlimited, but, the network matrixes is very large. So the more VMs there is, the more memory is needed.
