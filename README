SETUP
##################

To use these docker containers, you have to create an image based on one folder. And then run this image. 
This will create within the container, in the experience folder, a folder called output. You will just have to copy data from this folder on your computer.

##################
MODIFICATION
##################

You can change all the values in the input parameters file.
However, the number of file is limited to 67 200, due to automatic filename generation in the application. 
Also, this should be noted that, the number of VM is unlimited, but, the network matrixes get exponentially heavier in terms of memory.
